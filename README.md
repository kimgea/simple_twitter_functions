# simple_twitter_functions
Some simple twitter functions by using twitter api code. Usable for smaller twitter account, but not ment to be used. If you use this code, then you have to take resposibility for whaterver happends you self.

API data is not localy stored/cached and must be retrieved each time a function is called. Because of rate limits this makes functions use more time than nessesary.

Accounts with many friends and followers is takes way to long with this code.

Just ment as a small learning project with some practical applications.
Another project will adapt the code to work with db to minimize api calls, and other stuff.


TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY, TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET, TWITTER_USER_KEY, TWITTER_USER_SECRET, and SCREEN_NAME in settings must be filled out
